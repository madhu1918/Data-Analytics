		"text": "Flu epidemics constitute a major public health concern causing respiratory illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths. According to the National Vital Statistics Reports published in October 2012, influenza ranked as the eighth leading cause of death in 2011 in the United States. Each year, 250,000 to 500,000 deaths are attributed to influenza related diseases throughout the world.<br><br>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS) detect influenza activity through virologic and clinical data, including Influenza-like Illness (ILI) physician visits. Reporting national and regional data, however, are published with a 1-2 week lag.<br><br> The <a href=\"https://www.google.org/flutrends/us/#US\">Google Flu Trends</a> project was initiated to see if faster reporting can be made possible by considering flu-related online search queries -- data that is available almost immediately.Problem - Understanding the Data<br><br>We would like to estimate influenza-like illness (ILI) activity using Google web search logs. Fortunately, one can easily access this data online:<br><br>ILI Data - The CDC publishes on its website the official regional and state-level percentage of patient visits to healthcare providers for ILI purposes on a weekly basis.<br><br>Google Search Queries - Google Trends allows public retrieval of weekly counts for every query searched by users around the world. For each location, the counts are normalized by dividing the count for each query in a particular week by the total number of online search queries submitted in that location during the week. Then, the values are adjusted to be between 0 and 1.<br><br>The csv file FluTrain.csv aggregates this data from January 1, 2004 until December 31, 2011 as follows:\"Week\" - The range of dates represented by this observation, in year/month/day format.\"ILI\" - This column lists the percentage of ILI-related physician visits for the corresponding week.\"Queries\" - This column lists the fraction of queries that are ILI-related for the corresponding week, adjusted to be between 0 and 1 (higher values correspond to more ILI-related search queries).<br><br>Before applying analytics tools on the training set, we first need to understand the data at hand. Load \"FluTrain.csv\" into a data frame called FluTrain. Looking at the time period 2004-2011, which week corresponds to the highest percentage of ILI-related physician visits?"

This sort of dataset is called a \"time series.\" Often, statistical models can be improved by predicting the current value of the dependent variable using the value of the dependent variable from earlier weeks. In our models, this means we will predict the ILI variable in the current week using values of the ILI variable from previous weeks.<br>First, we need to decide the amount of time to lag the observations. Because the ILI variable is reported with a 1- or 2-week lag, a decision maker cannot rely on the previous week's ILI value to predict the current week's value. Instead, the decision maker will only have data available from 2 or more weeks ago.

While many functions are built into R, you need to add new packages to use some functions. New packages can be installed and loaded easily in R, and we will do this many times in this class.
