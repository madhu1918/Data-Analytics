This video will show you how to load the data into R.<br>An R script file with all of the commands used in this Lecture can be downloaded <a href=\"https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/f365d6d8f633e3d5e47897544d293433/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x+3T2018+type@asset+block/Unit6_Netflix.R\">here</a> <br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE: We'll be using a text editor in this video to get the data into R. If you are on a Mac and are using TextEdit, the default file type is .rtf, so you will need to change the file type to txt. To do this, just go to Format --> Make Plain Text, and the file will re-save as a txt file. Alternatively, depending on your operating system and web browser, you might just be able to save the file directly from the browser as a txt file."
