		"text": "A stock market is where buyers and sellers trade shares of a company, and is one of the most popular ways for individuals and companies to invest money. The size of the world stock market  is now estimated to be in the trillions. The largest stock market in the world is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), located in New York City. About 2,800 companies are listed on the NYSE.

Take a look at the structure of one of the datasets using the str function. Right now, the date variable is stored as a factor. We can convert this to a \"Date \" object in R by using the following five commands (one for each data set):<br>IBM$Date = as.Date(IBM$Date, \" % m / % d / % y \")<br>GE$Date = as.Date(GE$Date, \" % m / % d / % y \")<br>CocaCola$Date = as.Date(CocaCola$Date, \" % m / % d / % y \")<br>ProcterGamble$Date = as.Date(ProcterGamble$Date, \" % m / % d / % y \")<br>Boeing$Date = as.Date(Boeing$Date, \" % m / % d / % y \")<br>The first argument to the as.Date function is the variable we want to convert, and the second argument is the format of the Date variable. We can just overwrite the original Date variable values with the output of this function.

Let's fix this by giving each line a color. First, re-run the plot command for Coca-Cola, but add the argument col=\"red \". You should see the plot for Coca-Cola show up again, but this time in red. Now, let's add the Procter & Gamble line (using the lines function like we did before), adding the argument col=\"blue\". You should now see in your plot the Coca-Cola stock price in red, and the Procter & Gamble stock price in blue. As an alternative choice to changing the colors, you could instead change the line type of the Procter & Gamble line by adding the argument lty=2. This will make the Procter & Gamble line dashed.

The additional argument, ylim=c(0,210), makes the y-axis range from 0 to 210. This will allow us to see all of the stock values when we add in the other companies.Now, use the lines function to add in the other four companies, remembering to only plot the observations from 1995 to 2005, or [301:432]. You don't need the \"type \" or \"ylim \" arguments for the lines function, but remember to make each company a different color so that you can tell them apart. Some color options are \"red \", \"blue \", \"green \", \"purple \", \"orange \", and \"black \". To see all of the color options in R, type colors() in your R console.(If you prefer to change the type of the line instead of the color, here are some options for changing the line type: lty=2 will make the line dashed, lty=3 will make the line dotted, lty=4 will make the line alternate between dashes and dots, and lty=5 will make the line long-dashed.)Use this plot to answer the following four questions.Which stock fell the most right after the technology bubble burst in March 2000?"
