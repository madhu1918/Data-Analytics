				"text": "In the previous video, we built a logistic regression model and found that the following variables were significant (or almost significant) for predicting ten year risk of CHD: male, age, number of cigarettes per day, whether or not the patient previously had a stroke, whether or not the patient is currently hypertensive, total cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, and blood glucose level. Which one of the following variables would be the most dramatically affected by a behavioral intervention? HINT: Think about how much control the patient has over each of the variables"
